# AI in Software Engineering  

In this project we explored AIâ€™s role in code generation, testing, and predictive analytics for software engineering.  

## **Features**  

1. **AI-Powered Code Completion**: Compare manual vs. AI-generated Python functions.
     
2. **Automated Testing**: Selenium + AI plugins for login page testing.
    
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Random Forest model for issue prioritization.  

## **How to Use**  

1. Clone the repo:  
    
   git clone https://github.com/priscillanzula/AI-in-Software-Engineering.git
   
Run Jupyter Notebook for predictive modeling on breast cancer.



Results

Code Completion: AI suggestions reduced boilerplate by 40%.

Testing: AI improved test coverage by 3x.

Predictive Model: 65% accuracy in issue prioritization.
